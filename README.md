Fullstack code challenge

Create a Single-Page Application that provides information about Overwatch heroes. The task should be implemented in 150 minutes using either React.js or Angular.js for the frontend and Ruby for the backend.


The required data is stored at  https://s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dojomadness.com/code-challenge/heros


Keep in mind that your application should **NOT** use the s3 file directly but should use a local database instead.


----


The application should support following features.


1. Interface to display list of heroes

2. Infinite scroll pagination

3. Working deployment on https://heroku.com


----


Bonus points for:


- client-server architecture

- responsive design

- data persistence in application database

- filtering by hero name

- tests

- documentation

- anything that will impress us ;)
